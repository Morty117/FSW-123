# React JS
    - create-react-app is a software package on NPM
    - on the command line write "npx create-react-app myapp" runs but doesn't install and thus creates a folder you name after create-react
    - cd into your folder
    - after you cd use npm start to run your file

    = App.js will be the root/starting component file
    = Insided the RETURN statement is what will be rendered to the webpage
    = Definition of a functional component in React is a piece of code that has a function inside of it and it has a return statement that can be reusable that just returns HTML and JS
    = Components can be created either ES6 class or a regular function
    = Case sensitivity on the name of the component and the name of the file, EVERY file and component must start with a capital letter
